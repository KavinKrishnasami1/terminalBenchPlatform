  "analysis": "All requirements have been successfully implemented and verified:\n\n1. ✓ Main implementation in /app/ars.R with ars() function that accepts user inputs and validates them\n2. ✓ Formal testing with test() function that outputs clear PASS/FAIL messages with statistics\n3. ✓ Modular code design with 15+ discrete functions for specific tasks\n4. ✓ Input validation for n, f, support, and x_init\n5. ✓ Log-concavity checks during initialization and sampling\n6. ✓ Sample files generated: normal_samples.txt and exponential_samples.txt\n7. ✓ All 6 tests passing (Normal, Exponential, Beta, Gamma, Input Validation, Non-log-concave Detection)\n8. ✓ Samples follow target distributions (verified statistically)\n9. ✓ Clear error handling and informative messages\n10. ✓ Documentation in README.md\n\nThe implementation correctly follows the Gilks & Wild (1992) adaptive rejection sampling algorithm with piecewise linear envelopes, squeezing tests, and adaptive refinement.",
