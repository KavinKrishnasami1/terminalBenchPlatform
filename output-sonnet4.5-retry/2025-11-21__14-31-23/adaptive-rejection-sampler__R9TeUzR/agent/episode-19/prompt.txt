> ### Example 3: Gamma Distribution
> ```R
> source("ars.R")
> log_dgamma <- function(x) ifelse(x <= 0, -Inf, 2*log(x) - x)
> samples <- ars(1000, Vectorize(log_dgamma), c(0, Inf))
> hist(samples, breaks=30, main="ARS: Gamma(3,1)")

> ## Algorithm Overview
>
> The ARS algorithm works by:
>
> 1. Constructing piecewise linear upper and lower envelopes of the log-density
> 2. Sampling from the exponentiated upper envelope (piecewise exponential)
> 3. Using squeezing and rejection tests to accept/reject samples
> 4. Adaptively refining envelopes by adding points where rejections occur
>
> Key advantages:
> - Efficient for log-concave densities
> - Adaptive refinement improves acceptance rate over time
> - Works with unnormalized densities
> - Suitable for various distributions
>
> ## Requirements Met
>
> ✓ Primary function `ars()` implements adaptive rejection sampling
> ✓ Input validation (n, f, support, x_init)
> ✓ Log-concavity checking during initialization and sampling
> ✓ Modular code with discrete functions for specific tasks
> ✓ Comprehensive test suite with known distributions
> ✓ Test output format: "TEST_NAME: PASS" or "TEST_NAME: FAIL"
> ✓ Sample files generated: normal_samples.txt, exponential_samples.txt
> ✓ Clear error messages for invalid inputs
> ✓ Samples follow target distribution (validated via statistical tests)
