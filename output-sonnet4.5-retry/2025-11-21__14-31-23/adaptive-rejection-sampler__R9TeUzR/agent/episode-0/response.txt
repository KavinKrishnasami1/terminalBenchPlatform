I'll implement an adaptive rejection sampler (ARS) in R according to the Gilks et al. (1992) paper. Let me start by analyzing the current state and creating the implementation.

{
  "analysis": "The terminal is ready at /app directory. I need to: 1) Check if R is installed, 2) Implement the ARS algorithm in /app/ars.R with modular design, 3) Create comprehensive tests, 4) Generate sample output files.",
  "plan": "First, I'll check if R is installed. Then I'll create a modular implementation of the adaptive rejection sampler with: (a) input validation, (b) log-concavity checks, (c) envelope construction, (d) sampling mechanism, and (e) comprehensive testing with known distributions. The implementation will follow the ARS algorithm from Gilks & Wild (1992).",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "which R\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
