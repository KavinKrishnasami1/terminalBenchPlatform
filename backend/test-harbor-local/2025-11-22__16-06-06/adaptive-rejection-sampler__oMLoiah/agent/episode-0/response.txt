I'll implement an adaptive rejection sampler (ARS) in R based on Gilks et al. (1992). Let me start by analyzing the current state and creating the implementation.

{
  "analysis": "The terminal is ready at /app directory. I need to: 1) Check if R is installed, 2) Implement the ARS algorithm in /app/ars.R with modular design, 3) Create comprehensive tests, 4) Generate sample output files.",
  "plan": "First, check if R is installed. If not, install it. Then create the ars.R file with: (a) Main 'ars' function implementing adaptive rejection sampling, (b) Modular helper functions for initialization, envelope construction, sampling, updating, and log-concavity checking, (c) A 'test' function with formal tests against known distributions. Finally, run tests and generate sample files.",
  "commands": [
    {
      "keystrokes": "which R\n",
      "duration": 0.1
    }
  ]
}
