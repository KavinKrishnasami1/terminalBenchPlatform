  "analysis": "The samples are still showing lower variance than expected, which suggests an issue with the envelope sampling. The problem seems to be systematic - the variance is consistently too low. Let me check if the sample files were created and examine them, then debug the sampling more carefully. The issue might be in how I'm doing the inverse CDF sampling.",
